This project is an attempt to create a web application based on well-structured architecture and modern technologies. 
I picked a few interesting software architecture concepts and tried to apply them on a real-life example. 
To make an flexible web application I used the Service-oriented architecture (RESTful). 
I followed package by feature approach to ensure high modularity of the web services. 
The high-level design solutions were inspired by the hexagonal architecture principles to make code fully decoupled from the framework. 
In the core of each module I used the three-tier architecture.
